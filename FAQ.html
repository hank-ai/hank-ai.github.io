      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000'>How does Hank work?</h4>
      <p>
        Medical coders submit records to Hank.  Hank sends them to his secure servers for processing and returns a list of probable codes along with the free text contained in the record.
      </p>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000'>How do I use Hank?</h4>
      <p>
        Select the standard print function in your EMR system and choose the preinstalled Hank printer to submit the record.  When processing is complete, a list of codes along with the processed text will appear in Hank’s user interface.
      </p>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000' >How does Hank help me code medical records?</h4>
      <p>
        Hank doesn’t just return a list of suggested codes.  He also highlights the text inside the record that led him to each conclusion, so you can jump straight to the sections that are most relevant to selecting the right codes.
      </p>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000' id='contribute'>Is Hank Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) software?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. And no. Hank is similar to traditional CAC software - with one key difference. Hank elicits feedback and explanations from his users in order to improve continuously. And he will pay you for this expertise. Not only does Hank assist with medical coding, he pays you to teach him how to assist you better! Hank's back end is also capable of being deployed in conjunction with other software platforms to perform verification and auditing tasks that were once performed by humans.
      </p>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000' >How will I provide feedback to Hank?</h4>
      <p>
        Your feedback will be in the form of a free text explanation, but you will be provided with a few standard phrases to use when correcting codes to ensure Hank understands what he got wrong.  Your adherence to our suggested phrasing will be a part of how your feedback is rated.

      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000' id='contribute'>Why is Hank paying medical coders to help him learn?</h4>
      <p>
        Hank doesn’t know everything. He needs help. He needs to learn from a wide variety of experts in order to become an expert himself. Knowledge acquisition isn’t cheap. Ask any recent college graduate! With this in mind, Hank understands the value of medical coders’ expertise and is excited to reward them with financial incentives for helping him learn their specialty.

      <h4 style='color: #000' >Why does the world need Hank?</h4>
      <p>
        The US healthcare system is full of built-in costs related to services that add little or no value to patient outcomes. Traditional approaches have failed to prevent these costs from growing at rates far higher than those associated with actual patient care. Hank was made to learn and automate some of these expensive backend processes decreasing wasteful spending and returning capital to where it truly belongs - helping patients.
