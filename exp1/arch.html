            <!--Job displacement via automation has been at the center of countless labor disputes and controversies since the advent of the PLC in the late 1960's.  Now, AI is poised to bring an entirely new avenue of automation to businesses across a broad range of industry. Hank will be at the forefront of that revolution, but Hank is aware of his potential for harm.  That's why -->Hank's business model employs profit-sharing unlike any other in the industry.  If you contribute your expertise and time to one of Hank's models, you will receive a fair share of the profits generated by that model.  The goal is to provide you with a solid financial foundation to pursue your passions or train in another, more human-centric, occupation. This method of profit sharing is central to Hank's core philosophy of benefitting humanity first and catering to the bottom line second. At its heart, Hank's brand is one of inclusion and equality.  Thus our slogan: “Hank isn’t human. So you can be.”
            <br>
            <br>
            On the technical front, Hank is capable of learning not only via traditional retrospective machine learning but also through 'reading' explanations of the decision making process from experts like you. Hank will depend on you to correct his predictions and will learn from your feedback in near real time.  At the end of the day, this is how we all learn.  Our parents attempt to instill in us the lessons they've learned from their years of experience and then correct us when we fail to meet those ideals. But unlike us, Hank can learn from countless ‘parents’ simultaneously, and once he becomes an expert on a domain, Hank can be cloned to scale. This second teir knowledge-capture capability is another major differentiator between Hank and his competitors, and will ensure that he is best in class at increasing your productivity in the short run and returning profits that benefit all involved in the long run.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently, Hank is focused on delivering a medical coding solution for anesthesia billing companies.  This solution will entail a non-intrusive graphical user interface that will alert the medical coder when it detects potentially pertinent information on the user's screen.  If the user decides to process the information through Hank, he will return a predicted medical code along with the text of the record--highlighted to show the exact information used to come to his conclusion.  If the result is incorrect, the end user will change the code to the appropriate value and provide a free form text explanation as to why that code was chosen.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of the technology involved is being developed with future extensibility in mind.  The platform itself is domain agnostic.  The same technology will be capable of being deployed in any domain in which documented human decision making is a critical part of the workflow and free text feedback from end users is a viable avenue for model support. In technical jargon, Hank can automate any decision in which all inputs are digital and the output is non-ambiguous amongst domain experts.
